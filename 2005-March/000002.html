+
+Works great!  Anyone who bashes your code has to answer to me.  
+
+I hit refresh quite often to build a new map (sorry I couldn't resist).  Thank heavens for my cable modem!  The maps are perfect - nice and random and quite legal.
+
+The only real note is that sometimes a map will generate that is too &quot;wide&quot; and it extends beyond the right edge of the image, and is cut off.  I'm not sure if you are doing it this way, but in my drawing routine I create a &quot;blank&quot; image that is the correct size (based on the final mapGrid dimensions) and then plop the tiles into it.  I found that the perfect (x,y) coordinates for the final image size are:
+
+width: (endingX * (tile.width * .75)) + tile.width
+height: (endingY * tile.height) + tile.height + (tile.height/2)
+
+Also, in my program I have a &quot;minimap&quot; view for navigation. But it is restricted to a specific size. So when I have to resize my big image down and make sure it fits in the bounds of its &quot;container&quot; I also have to make sure a &quot;wide&quot; map and a &quot;tall&quot; map will both fit.  So here is some pseudo-code that does this:
+
+if bigMapPic.width &gt; bigMapPic.height then
+    smallMapPic.width = smallPicContainer.width
+    smallMapPic.height = bigMapPic.height*(smallPicContainer.width/bigMapPic.width)
+else
+    smallMapPic.width = bigMapPic.width*(smallPicContainer.height/bigMapPic.height)
+    smallMapPic.height = smallPicContainer.height
+end if
+
+Hope that helps!

+magic is supplied in the five VALLEY tiles and the RUINS tile, GOLD
+magic is supplied in the six WOODS tiles, and PURPLE magic is supplied
+in the MOUNTAIN, LEDGES, CLIFF, HIGH PASS, CAVES and
+CAVERN tiles. GREY, GOLD and PURPLE magic are supplied in every
+clearing on the CRAG tile. In the BORDERLAND tile, GREY magic is
+supplied in clearing &#147;1&#148;, GOLD magic is supplied in clearings &#147;2&#148; and &#147;3&#148;,
+PURPLE magic is supplied in clearings &#147;4&#148; and &#147;5&#148;, and both GREY and
+PURPLE magic are supplied in clearing &#147;6&#148;.
+
+b. When a tile supplies color magic to a clearing, it also supplies color
+magic to every roadway that runs into that clearing. When a character is on
+a roadway between two clearings, both clearings supply him with color
+magic. EXAMPLE: When a character is on a roadway between an
+enchanted VALLEY tile and an enchanted WOODS tile, he is supplied with
+both GREY and GOLD magic.
+
+
+
+---
+
+2) When using the phantasm spell, IIUC the phantasm and caster can use each other's color magic sources (eg: they are on different enchanted tiles) to allow the phantasm to enchant the tile (7.10.5 3ed). If the phantasm does the RE activity, I assume it needs to do an EM phase first (even if the caster doesn't need to), then the caster must supply the appropriate ritual magic. The caster can also do the RE during his own turn, using color magic from the phantasm's clearing. In both cases, can each one only 
+
+--&gt; phantasm expires after daylight anyway

+
+
+Hi Dan -
+
+I'd appreciate it if you could clarify 3 questions. I apologize for the length; if it's any consolation, if you answer them I'll post them to the wiki board! 
+
+1) If the Woods Girl is using her optional ability to extend her tracking skills to all woods clearings (except for Ruins and Valley tiles), what is considered a 'mountain' in cases like, for instance, Cliff clearings 2, 3, and 5? Are they mountain or woods? Based on the definition:
+
+There are three types of clearings: black underground clearings are cave clearings or &quot;caves&quot;; light brown clearings surrounded by grey mountain ridges are &quot;mountain&quot; clearings; and all other clearings are &#147;woods&#148; clearings.
+
+I would guess 'woods' since they aren't surrounded.
+
+2) When using enhanced magic + artifacts and spell books (which IIUC we are), does that mean magic-users can have an unlimited number of, say, broomstick chits? If multiple absorb-essence spells have been cast, what order are they energized in, first -&gt; last or last -&gt; first (I think the former)? I understand that if they are all energized simultaneously (eg: toadstool circle)the caster can choose what he transmorphizes into. 
+
+For a contrived scenario, say the Witch has three spells active, affecting monsters A, B, C (oldest -&gt; most recent spell cast). She activates an enchanted  black-magic chit, so she transforms into A (?). Then someone stumbles into her clearing and discovers the toadstool circle. Can she choose to transform into any of the three, or only B and C now?
+
+3) If multiple enchant-artifact spells are in effect on a spellbook, does it need to be energized once for each spell to be made available (or will a single color chit activate them all?), and if so, can the caster choose which spell (or is it ordered similar to absorb-essence)? 
+
+With the enhanced rules, if, say, a type II spellbook is enchanted (per Enchant Artifact) with type III spells, and it is currently enchanted to grey magic, are the type III spells available, or is the book unavailable while enchanted? Does activating the book to use as a source of grey color magic count towards it being used, so it's type II spells are unavailable that Evening? Can the user activate the grey magic from the book to activate a type III spell on the enchanted book itself (making the type III spell immediately available)?
+
+

+
+Picking a Character:
+
+Choose one of the following (the rest are at a disadvantage in this encounter):
+
+Amazon
+	starts in Inn.
+Dward
+	starts at Guard House or Inn.
+Swordsman
+	starts at Inn.
+White Knight
+	Starts at Inn or Chapel.
+Wizard
+	starts at Inn, House, or Guard House.
+Woods Girl
+	starts at Inn or House.
+
+Get character card, counter (large round counter), all 12 action chits, and weapon
+and armor counters listed in fourth (final) development stage (only those).
+
+Get a Personal History Pad (PHP), write down your character's special advantages.
+Choose dwelling where character will start and victory conditions (secretly).
+
+
+Victory Requirements:
+
+Choose 5 points total and distribute them among the four categories.
+They represent what is most important to the character.
+Characters get a bonus for exceeding these requirements, and are penalized for 
+failing to meet them.
+
+TODO: computing victory points, winning
+
+
+Ending the Game:
+
+Characters may leave the may or suicide.
+If character leaves the map, compute score immediately. 
+
+At the end of the game, characters discard all items they cannot carry.
+Count up the score in each category and subtract requirement recorded. If &lt; 0, 
+multiply by 3 as a penalty.
+
+Basic score: divide each category by its factor (round down).
+Bonus score: multiply basic score in each category by victory points assigned.
+Total score: sum of all basic and bonus scores.
+
+Each character who has a total score of 0 has fulfilled victory requirements
+and can be said to have won the game. 
+
+Victor is character with most points. There may be a victor without a winner!
+
+
+Activities:
+
+Each character gets one turn per day to do activities.
+Characters can perform one action per phase.
+If character spends whole day outside of caves, he gets four phases. 
+Otherwise, he only gets two.
+
+The day is divided into these phases:
+  TODO: Daily Sequence of Play
+
+
+You may pick one activity per phase. 
+The following activities must be recorded in advance in the activity section of the PHP
+during Birdsong:
+
+Move, Search, Hide, Rest, Trade (with natives/visitors), 
+Enhanced Peer (must have special item).
+
+The following can be done in the Evening:
+Trade (between characters), Arrange Belongings, Block.
+
+
+Move:
+  Must move from clearing to clearing, one clearing at a time.
+
+  To record, write &quot;M &lt;tile&gt; &lt;clearing&gt;&quot;, where tile can be an abbreviation
+  and clearing is the number. Example: M NW-2 to move to second clearing of Nut Woods.
+  To avoid ambiguity, use 'CG' for Crag, 'CL' for Cliff, 'CS' for Caves, 'CN' for 
+  Cavern.
+
+  May play a move chit whenever leaving a clearing (this is not fatigued), 
+  or active horse or Boots card. Any of these can be played each move.
+    The strength of this chit must meet or exceed the heaviest item the character has,
+	else the character must drop the heavy item(s) (he cannot choose not to move 
+	if the move was plotted in advance).
+  
+  Mountain:
+    Costs two movements (consecutive, during same day) to enter mountain clearing.
+
+  Cave:
+    Cannot enter cave during day in which character used sunlight activity.
+
+  Horses:
+    Horses which are active are being ridden, else they are pack horses and follow 
+	character. Horses cannot enter caves (immediately become inactive).
+
+    To get move bonus, must have horse active during Birdsong and active when he
+	executes the phase during Daylight.
+
+    Warhorse: not extra movement
+	Pack horse: one extra move phase
+	Pony: double move phases
+
+
+
+
+Search:
+  May pick which table to use (Peer, Locate, Loot).
+
+Hide:
+  Characters are hidden at start of game.
+  Characters are unhidden at start of each turn.
+  To record, write 'H'.
+  To hide, roll dice and check the Hide table. If successful, turn counter green side up.
+  Hidden characters are green side up (tan means unhidden).
+  Hidden characters can do activities. If they block, they are immediately unhidden.
+  Monsters cannot block hidden characters.
+  Natives and visitors can block charater if he rolls on Meeting Table (even if hidden).
+	
+Rest:
+  To record, write 'R'.
+  May activate one fatigued asterisk or convert one wounded asterisk to a
+  fatigued asterisk after each rest activity. May exchange chits to 'make change'.
+
+  TODO: fatigue, wounds
+
+
+Trade:
+  To record, write 'T'.
+  May buy one item or sell any number of items during each trade activity.
+  May buy natives drinks to (hopefully) improve success during trading. This costs 
+  one gold per member of the group.
+
+  Characters must reveal all treasure items they obtain as a result of a trade.
+  TODO: repairing items, fame price, 
+
+Arrange Items:
+
+
+Blocking:
+  Monsters, natives, and characters may block each other.
+  Only time a character can block or be blocked is during his turn.
+  When a character blocks or is blocked, his turn ends instantly and he is unhidden.
+  Monsters cannot block hidden characters.
+  Natives and visitors can block charater if he rolls on Meeting Table (even if hidden).

+I'm leaning towards TCP/HTTP, but really, it should be independent of the underlying network protocol. OTOH, HTTP might be somewhat limiting, given its pull request/response nature (we may want to support asyncronous/push notifications). I've always hated 'pull' architectures in which clients have to continuously poll for updates... it winds up being so inefficient (in many cases, at least). That's just the nature of the web, I suppose.

+Newbie's Guide to Magic Realm:
+
+This is a distilled summary of the Magic Realm rules for new players.
+It is primarily designed to get new players up to speed quickly (hopefully 
+along with with more experienced players who know how to setup the board).
+
+The game rules are divided into four sections, called Encounters. There are
+also Advanced and Optional rules.
+
+
+Encounter 1:
+
+Rolling Dice: 
+
+Roll two dice, pick the highest result.
+
+
+Picking a Character:
+
+Choose one of the following (the rest are at a disadvantage in this encounter):
+
+Amazon
+	starts in Inn.
+Dward
+	starts at Guard House or Inn.
+Swordsman
+	starts at Inn.
+White Knight
+	Starts at Inn or Chapel.
+Wizard
+	starts at Inn, House, or Guard House.
+Woods Girl
+	starts at Inn or House.
+
+Get character card, counter (large round counter), all 12 action chits, and weapon
+and armor counters listed in fourth (final) development stage (only those).
+
+Get a Personal History Pad (PHP), write down your character's special advantages.
+Choose dwelling where character will start and victory conditions (secretly).
+
+
+Victory Requirements:
+
+Choose 5 points total and distribute them among the four categories.
+They represent what is most important to the character.
+Characters get a bonus for exceeding these requirements, and are penalized for 
+failing to meet them.
+
+TODO: computing victory points, winning
+
+
+Ending the Game:
+
+Characters may leave the may or suicide.
+If character leaves the map, compute score immediately. 
+
+At the end of the game, characters discard all items they cannot carry.
+Count up the score in each category and subtract requirement recorded. If &lt; 0, 
+multiply by 3 as a penalty.
+
+Basic score: divide each category by its factor (round down).
+Bonus score: multiply basic score in each category by victory points assigned.
+Total score: sum of all basic and bonus scores.
+
+Each character who has a total score of 0 has fulfilled victory requirements
+and can be said to have won the game. 
+
+Victor is character with most points. There may be a victor without a winner!
+
+
+Activities:
+
+Each character gets one turn per day to do activities.
+Characters can perform one action per phase.
+If character spends whole day outside of caves, he gets four phases. 
+Otherwise, he only gets two.
+
+The day is divided into these phases:
+  TODO: Daily Sequence of Play
+
+
+You may pick one activity per phase. 
+The following activities must be recorded in advance in the activity section of the PHP
+during Birdsong:
+
+Move, Search, Hide, Rest, Trade (with natives/visitors), 
+Enhanced Peer (must have special item).
+
+The following can be done in the Evening:
+Trade (between characters), Arrange Belongings, Block.
+
+
+Move:
+  Must move from clearing to clearing, one clearing at a time.
+
+  To record, write &quot;M &lt;tile&gt; &lt;clearing&gt;&quot;, where tile can be an abbreviation
+  and clearing is the number. Example: M NW-2 to move to second clearing of Nut Woods.
+  To avoid ambiguity, use 'CG' for Crag, 'CL' for Cliff, 'CS' for Caves, 'CN' for 
+  Cavern.
+
+  May play a move chit whenever leaving a clearing (this is not fatigued), 
+  or active horse or Boots card. Any of these can be played each move.
+    The strength of this chit must meet or exceed the heaviest item the character has,
+	else the character must drop the heavy item(s) (he cannot choose not to move 
+	if the move was plotted in advance).
+  
+  Mountain:
+    Costs two movements (consecutive, during same day) to enter mountain clearing.
+
+  Cave:
+    Cannot enter cave during day in which character used sunlight activity.
+
+  Horses:
+    Horses which are active are being ridden, else they are pack horses and follow 
+	character. Horses cannot enter caves (immediately become inactive).
+
+    To get move bonus, must have horse active during Birdsong and active when he
+	executes the phase during Daylight.
+
+    Warhorse: not extra movement
+	Pack horse: one extra move phase
+	Pony: double move phases
+
+
+
+
+Search:
+  May pick which table to use (Peer, Locate, Loot).
+
+Hide:
+  Characters are hidden at start of game.
+  Characters are unhidden at start of each turn.
+  To record, write 'H'.
+  To hide, roll dice and check the Hide table. If successful, turn counter green side up.
+  Hidden characters are green side up (tan means unhidden).
+  Hidden characters can do activities. If they block, they are immediately unhidden.
+  Monsters cannot block hidden characters.
+  Natives and visitors can block charater if he rolls on Meeting Table (even if hidden).
+	
+Rest:
+  To record, write 'R'.
+  May activate one fatigued asterisk or convert one wounded asterisk to a
+  fatigued asterisk after each rest activity. May exchange chits to 'make change'.
+
+  TODO: fatigue, wounds
+
+
+Trade:
+  To record, write 'T'.
+  May buy one item or sell any number of items during each trade activity.
+  May buy natives drinks to (hopefully) improve success during trading. This costs 
+  one gold per member of the group.
+
+  Characters must reveal all treasure items they obtain as a result of a trade.
+  TODO: repairing items, fame price, 
+
+Arrange Items:
+
+
+Blocking:
+  Monsters, natives, and characters may block each other.
+  Only time a character can block or be blocked is during his turn.
+  When a character blocks or is blocked, his turn ends instantly and he is unhidden.
+  Monsters cannot block hidden characters.
+  Natives and visitors can block charater if he rolls on Meeting Table (even if hidden).
+
+
+Discoveries:
+  Discoveries are transferable (may be sold or discovered by spying).
+  
+  Spying: TODO
+
+
+Trade Between Characters:
+
+Sharing Information:
+
+
+
+
+Second Encounter:
+
+Characters:
+  TODO
+
+
+
+Activites:
+  Alert (TODO: must be recorded? must use up full activity?)
+
+
+Combat:
+
+  encounter:
+    may play a move chit to run away or a fight chit to activate a weapon 
+    (only if movement time &lt; all monsters' times)
+	if chit was not played, may activate/inactivate one belonging or abandon any 
+	belongings.
+
+  melee:
+    when weapon hits, turn unalerted side up
+    when weapon misses, turn alerted side up
+    
+
+
